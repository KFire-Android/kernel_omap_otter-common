* palmas and palmas charger GPIO IP block devicetree bindings

Required properties:
- compatible : Should be from the list
  ti,twl6035-gpio
  ti,twl6036-gpio
  ti,twl6037-gpio
  ti,tps65913-gpio
  ti,tps65914-gpio
  ti,tps80036-gpio

and also the generic series names

  ti,palmas-gpio

- gpio-controller: mark the device as a GPIO controller
- gpio-cells = <1>:  GPIO lines are provided.
- interrupt-controller : palmas has its own internal IRQs
- #interrupt-cells : should be set to 2 for IRQ number and flags
  The first cell is the IRQ number.
  The second cell is the flags, encoded as the trigger masks from
  Documentation/devicetree/bindings/interrupts.txt
- interrupt-parent : The parent interrupt controller.

Example:

gpio {
    compatible = "ti,twl6035-gpio", "ti,palmas-gpio";

    gpio-controller;
    #gpio-cells = <1>;
    interrupt-parent = <&palmas>;
    interrupt-controller;
    #interrupt-cells = <2>;
};
