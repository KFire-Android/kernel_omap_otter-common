OMAP Timer bindings

Required properties:
- compatible:		Must be "ti,omap2-timer" for OMAP2+ controllers.
- reg:			Contains timer register address range (base address and
			length).
- interrupts: 		Contains the interrupt information for the timer. The
			format is being dependent on which interrupt controller
			the OMAP device uses.
- ti,hwmods:		Name of the hwmod associated to the timer, "timer<X>",
			where <X> is the instance number of the timer from the
			HW spec.

Optional properties:
- ti,timer-alwon:	Indicates the timer is in an alway-on power domain.
- ti,timer-dsp:		Indicates the timer can interrupt the on-chip DSP in
			addition to the ARM CPU.
- ti,timer-ipu:		Indicates the timer can interrupt the on-chip IPU (the
			dual Cortex-M3/Cortex-M4 subsystem on OMAP4/OMAP5) in
			addition to the ARM CPU.
- ti,timer-pwm: 	Indicates the timer can generate a PWM output.
- ti,timer-secure: 	Indicates the timer is reserved on a secure OMAP device
			and therefore cannot be used by the kernel.
- ti,timer-non-wkup	Indicates the timer is in non-wkup power domain and hence
			will lose register context when the power domain transitions

Example:

timer12: timer@48304000 {
	compatible = "ti,omap2-timer";
	reg = <0x48304000 0x400>;
	interrupts = <95>;
	ti,hwmods = "timer12"
	ti,timer-alwon;
	ti,timer-secure;
};
