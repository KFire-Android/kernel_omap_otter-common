Required properties:
- compatible:   Must be "ti,omap4-dmm" for OMAP4 family
		Must be "ti,omap5-dmm" for OMAP5 family
- reg:         Contains timer register address range (base address and length)
- interrupts:  Contains interrupt information (source, etc) for the DMM IRQ

dmm: dmm@4e000000 {
	compatible = "ti,omap4-dmm";
	reg = <0x4e000000 0x800>;
	ti,hwmods = "dmm";
};
