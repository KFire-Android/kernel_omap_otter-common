Device Tree Clock bindings for Texas Instrument's OMAP compatible platforms

This binding is an initial minimal binding that may be enhanced as part of
transitioning OMAP clock data out of kernel image.

This binding uses the common clock binding[1].

[1] Documentation/devicetree/bindings/clock/clock-bindings.txt

Required properties:
- compatible : shall be "ti,omap-clock"
- #clock-cells : from common clock binding; shall be set to 0.
NOTE:
node name should map to clock database in arch/arm/mach-omap2/cclock<SoC>_data.c
Since all clocks are described with _ck, the node name is optimized to drop the
usage of _ck. For example, a clock called dpll1_ck will be defined as dpll1.

Example #1: describing clock node for CPU on OMAP34xx platform:
Ref: arch/arm/mach-omap2/cclock3xxx_data.c
describes the CPU clock to be as follows
	CLK(NULL,	"dpll1_ck",	&dpll1_ck,	CK_3XXX),
Corresponding binding will be:
	dpll1: dpll1 {
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		compatible = "ti,omap-clock";
	};
And it's usage will be:
		clocks = <&dpll1>;

Example #2: describing clock node for auxilary clock #3 on OMAP443x platform:
Ref: arch/arm/mach-omap2/cclock44xx_data.c
describes the auxclk3 clock to be as follows:
	CLK(NULL,	"auxclk3_ck",	&auxclk3_ck,	CK_443X),
Corresponding binding will be:
	auxclk3: auxclk3 {
		#clock-cells = <0>;
		compatible = "ti,omap-clock";
	};
And it's usage will be:
	clocks = <&auxclk3>;
