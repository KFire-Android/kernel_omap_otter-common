* Texas Instrument WiLink module

Wilink module is a combo wireless connectivity sdio card based on
Texas Instrument's wl18xx solution.
It is a 4-wire, 1.8V, embedded sdio wlan device with an external irq
line and is power-controlled by a gpio-based fixed regulator.

Required properties:
- compatible: "wlcore, kim, btwilink"
- irq : The interrupt number of the out-of-band interrupt line which is connected to the wilink module
- gpio: In case an gpio-irq is used, this field should hold the relevant gpio number.
  Only one of the two (gpio/irq) should be specified, according to the platform
- flow_cntrl: Field to enabl/disable use of flow control
- baud_rate: baud rate to use while using BT uart controller
