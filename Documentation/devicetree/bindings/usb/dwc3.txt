synopsys DWC3 CORE

DWC3- USB3 CONTROLLER

Required properties:
 - compatible: must be "synopsys,dwc3"
 - reg : Address and length of the register set for the device
 - interrupts: Interrupts used by the dwc3 controller.
 - usb-phy : array of phandle for the PHY device

Optional properties:
 - tx-fifo-resize: determines if the FIFO *has* to be reallocated.
 - dr_mode: tells Dual-Role USB controllers that we want to work on a
 			particular mode. Valid arguments are "host",
 			"peripheral" and "otg". In case this attribute isn't
 			passed via DT, USB DRD controllers should default to
 			OTG.
- maximum-speed: tells USB controllers we want to work up to a certain
			speed. Valid arguments are "superspeed", "highspeed",
			"fullspeed" and "lowspeed". In case this isn't passed
			via DT, USB controllers should default to their maximum
			HW capability.
This is usually a subnode to DWC3 glue to which it is connected.
