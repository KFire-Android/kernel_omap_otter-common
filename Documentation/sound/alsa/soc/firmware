ASoC Firmware Interface
=======================

ASoC now provides a simple firmware helper interface to allow drivers to load
kcontrols, widgets, simple coefficients and DAPM graphs alongside their 
firmware text.

Modern audio DSP devices usually have a tight coupling between their firmware
and the kcontrols, widgets and graph they implement. It makes sense to allow
ASoC to generate the ASoC specific objects that define the driver by reading
them from firmware file(s) rather than having them hard coded in the DSP driver. 
This allows vendors to write a single DSP component driver for many different
end user devices with the differentiation coming from the firmware.


ASoC Firmware Features
======================

The ASoC firmware interface takes firmware data and reads standard headers that
define each section in the firmware. It can then displatch the firmware section
to either the component driver or the generic ASoC firmware core for processing
and enumeration. The firmware sections can come in any order and can come from
more than one firmware file, although each file will require a request to the
kernel fimrware API in order to load the data.

The ASoC firmware headers are very simple and define the section type, size,
version, ABI as well as verifying that the section is valid. There is an 
alsa-utils based tool that can be used to add a section header to a firmware
file. Firmware files can be concatentaed together using tools like cat to create
a single firmware file from numerous firmware files.

Firmware sections can have the following types :- 

 o kcontrols (with or without TLV data)
 o kcontrols (with coefficient data - for simple one time coefficients)
 o DAPM widgets with associated kcontrol(s)
 o DAPM graph elements
 o Firmware text
 o Firmware configuration data

The firmware header is defined in include/uapi/sound/asoc.h as :-

/*
 * File and Block Header
 */
struct snd_soc_fw_hdr {
	__le32 magic;
	__le32 abi;		/* ABI version */
	__le32 type;
	__le32 vendor_type;	/* optional vendor specific type info */
	__le32 version;		/* optional vendor specific version details */
	__le32 size;		/* data bytes, excluding this header */
} __attribute__((packed));


Component Driver API
====================

Component drivers can use the ASoC firmware interface by calling either :- 

int snd_soc_fw_load_card(struct snd_soc_card *card,
	struct snd_soc_fw_card_ops *ops, const struct firmware *fw,
	u32 index);
int snd_soc_fw_load_platform(struct snd_soc_platform *platform,
	struct snd_soc_fw_platform_ops *ops, const struct firmware *fw,
	u32 index);
int snd_soc_fw_load_codec(struct snd_soc_codec *codec,
	struct snd_soc_fw_codec_ops *ops, const struct firmware *fw,
	u32 index);

depending on the type of the component driver. The component driver passes in a
pointer to itself and a pointer to the firmware object (requested using FW API).
It also passes in a pointer to some some internal functions that are used to 
initialise any firmware object or assign private data. Finally an index number
can be passed to identify all objects created with this firmware so that
component drivers can load and remove multiple firmware objects based on this
number.

Firmware objects can be removed with the following calls :-

void snd_soc_fw_dcontrols_remove_codec(struct snd_soc_codec *codec, u32 index);
void snd_soc_fw_dcontrols_remove_platform(struct snd_soc_platform *platform, u32 index);
void snd_soc_fw_dcontrols_remove_card(struct snd_soc_card *soc_card, u32 index);

The ASoC FW interface for component drivers is defined in include/sound/soc-fw.h
