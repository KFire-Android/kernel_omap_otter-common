OMAP HSI API's How To
=====================

The MIPI High Speed Synchronous Serial Interface (HSI) is a high speed
communication interface that is used for connecting OMAP to a cellular modem
engine.
It is specified by the MIPI alliance (www.mipi.org). An introduction to the
MIPI HSI working group can be found here: http://www.mipi.org/wgoverview.shtml

The HSI interface supports full duplex communication over multiple channels and
is capable of reaching speeds up to 200 Mbit/s.

The OMAP HSI driver supports both OMAP MIPI HSI (as defined in
MIPI documentation mipi_HSI-PL_specification_v01-01-00a.pdf) and OMAP SSI
devices through different device files, and a generic SW driver.

Please refer to the MIPI specifications for more details on this device.


I OMAP HSI driver API overview
-----------------------------

A) HSI Bus, HSI channels and protocol drivers overview.

The OMAP HSI driver implements the low-level support for the HSI device. It
abstracts device specifics and provides a simple interface inside the kernel
for data transmission on the HSI channels.
The OMAP HSI driver does not implement any communication protocol.
The SW layers using the OMAP HSI driver may implement a communication protocol
if required, and are commonly called 'protocol drivers' in this document.

The OMAP HSI abstracts the concept of HSI channels by creating an HSI bus and
attaching HSI channel devices to it. (see Figure 1)

Protocol drivers will then claim one or more HSI channels, after registering
with the OMAP HSI driver.

(NOTE: omap_hsi.pX-cY represents the HSI channel Y on port X from the omap_hsi
device)

B) Data transfers

The OMAP HSI driver exports an asynchronous interface for sending and receiving
data over the HSI channels. Protocol drivers will register a set of read and
write completion callbacks for each HSI channel they use.

Protocol drivers call hsi_write/hsi_read functions to signal the OMAP HSI driver
that is willing to write/read data to/from a channel. Transfers are completed
only when the OMAP HSI driver calls the completion callback.

An HSI channel can simultaneously have both a read and a write request
pending, however, requests cannot be queued.

It is safe to call hsi_write/hsi_read functions inside the callback functions.
In fact, a protocol driver should normally re-issue the read request from within
the read callback, in order to not miss any incoming messages.

Note on read / write operations:
A read or write is performed using a HSI internal DMA channel, unless the size
of data to transmit is one 32bits Word, where the transmission is directly
managed through interrupts.

C) Error handling

HSI is a multi channel interface but the channels share the same physical wires.
Therefore, any transmission error potentially affects all the protocol drivers
that sit on top of the HSI driver. Whenever an error occurs, it is broadcast
to all protocol drivers.

Errors are signaled to the protocol drivers through the port_event callback.

Completion callbacks functions are only called when a transfer has success.

D) Supported modes of operation

The driver supports stream and frame transmission modes and synchronized and
pipelined data flows.
The driver implements the HSI support for the core MPU and not for the
potential co-processors.

		Notes:
		HSI: A special value (0x1000) can be passed as bit-rate divisor
		to request the HSR so switch to auto-divisor mode (in this mode,
		the HSR can receive at any speed, but the error detection is
		deactivated). To exit this RX auto-divisor mode, a new divisor
		must be programmed for HSI (can be 0), and the error-detection
		is re-enabled.
		SSI: The same special 0x1000 value is used to deactivate the SSR
		timeout counter. This counter can be re-enabled by programming
		the 0x1001 value as bit-rate divisor. The SSI does not accept
		any other SSR bit-rate divisor values.

	constraints on OPP may have to be handled. This shall be managed by the
	HSI driver user.
