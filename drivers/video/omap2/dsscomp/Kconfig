	help
	  Frame composition driver using OMAP DSS2. Allows using
	  all DSS2 resources in a unified configuration. Should not
	  be used together with other DSS2 devices, such as V4L2
	  or OMAPFB.

config DSSCOMP_DEBUG_LOG
	bool "Log event timestamps in debugfs"
	default n
	depends on DEBUG_FS && DSSCOMP

	help
	  Takes timestamp for each callback and state transition, and
	  logs the last 128 entries (last few frames' worth) in a
	  log buffer.  This is a separate menuconfig in case this is
	  deemed an overhead.
