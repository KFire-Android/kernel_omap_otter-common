         Mailbox is a framework to control hardware communication between
         on-chip processors through queued messages and interrupt driven
         signals. Say Y if your platform supports hardware mailboxes.

         Specify the default size of mailbox's kfifo buffers (bytes).
         This can also be changed at runtime (via the mbox_kfifo_size
         module parameter).
